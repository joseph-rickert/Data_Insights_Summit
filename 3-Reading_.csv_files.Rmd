In this module we will read a .csv file from the web by using its url and put it into and R data frame. Then we will write the data to disk as a .csv file and read it back into the R environment.


## Fetch some data from Yahoo Finance  
To find the url for the IBM data yourself: go to http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=IBM+Historical+Prices. Then, go to the bottom of the page where it says "Download Spreadsheet", Copy the link to the table. 
The following code already has the url in it. It reads the data directly from the URL into an R data frame.
```{r}

url <- "http://real-chart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=IBM&d=1&e=1&f=2016&g=d&a=0&b=2&c=1962&ignore=.csv"
IBM.stock <- read.table(url,header=TRUE,sep=",")
head(IBM.stock)
```   
## Write the data to disk
Having taken the trouble to fetch the data from the web we can write it to a local disk,but where shall we write the data. The following command will wite it to the current working directory.

```{r}
write.csv(IBM.stock,file="IBM.stock.csv",row.names=FALSE)
getwd()           # Get the path to the local directory
```   
It is good practice, however, to put data in its own permanent directory. I have a directory called "DATA" on my C drive (C:\DATA) under which I store data in subdirectories. The following code shows how to create a directory from within R and then write the data there.  

```{r}
# Create a directory to store the data
dirName <- "IBM"
dirPath <- "C:/DATA"
dir <- file.path(dirPath,dirName)
dir.create(path=dir, showWarnings = TRUE, recursive = FALSE)

# Write the data to a .csv file
fileName <- "IBM.stock.csv"
file <- file.path(dir,fileName)
write.csv(IBM.stock,file=file,row.names=FALSE)

# See if the file is in the directory
list.files(dir)

```
## Read the .csv file from disk

```{R}
# first remove the data frame from the R environment
rm(IBM.stock)
IBM.stock <- read.csv(file)
head(IBM.stock,2)
```
