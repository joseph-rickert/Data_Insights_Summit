knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
## R is interpreted
R is an interpretive language. At its most basic, the console can be used as a simple calculator. 

```{r}
2 + 2 
```
Putting ";" after a statement lets you put several statements on the same line.
```{r}
log(10); sqrt(99); sin(pi)
```

## R was built for statistical analysis. 
Here we draw 1000 numbers from a Normal (Gaussian) distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 and assign them to the vector x all in one line of code.   
```{r}
x <- rnorm(1000)
```   
Notice that nothing happened. R normally does not give you any output until you ask for it. Here are some basic ways of asking for output. 

```{r}
head(x, 10)   # Look at the first 10 numbers in the vector x
tail(x,5)     # Look at the last 5 numbers in the vector xlength(x)     
length(x)     # To check on the length of x
summary(x)    # Get a summary of x
plot(x)       # Produce a scatter plot of x the index (the numbers 1 to 1000)
hist(x)       # Look at the histogram
```    

Notice that typing # is the way to introduct a comment.  

Next, we produce a fancier histogram with some color, a superimposed standard normal distribution curve and a "rug" underneath showing where the points are.
```{r}
hist(x, freq = FALSE, col = "pink")         
curve(dnorm,                                    # plot normal density
      col = "dark blue",                        # set coor of curve
      lwd=2,                                    # fill in the area under the curve
      add = TRUE)                               # add curve to existing plot
rug(x,col="red") 
```   

## R is rich in built in functions.
In addition to the mathematical functions sin(), log() etc rnorm(), head(), tail(), length(), summary(), plot(), hist(), curve() are all R functions.

To get help with a function named foo, type ?foo
```{r}
?rnorm
```   

## R is vectorized. 
There is not so much of a need to write loops in R
```{r}
y <- 1:10         # Assign the numbers 1 to 10 to a vector
y                 # Print the vector
2 + y; 2 * y      # Perform vector addition and multiplication
``` 
## There are lots of built in data sets in R
Type "data()" to see what data sets are available. The output which will appear under a new tab when you type this in the IDE depends on what packages you have loaded. Type data(ds_name) to load the data set. Then type ds_name to look at it
```{r}
data()
data(mtcars)
help(mtcars)      #  or type ?mtcars
head(mtcars)      #  to look at the first 6 rows
```
The fundamental data structure for doing statistical analysis is a data frame. 
mtcars is a data frame. You can check this with the class() function.
```{r}
class(mtcars)     # To check on the class of an R object
class(x)
```

## R shines at exploratory data analysis
                     
Use the with() function to work with the variables in the data frame
```{r}
with(mtcars,cor(drat,mpg))        
# There is a positive correlation beteen therear axel ratio and mpg!!
```
Use $ to refer directly to the variables in the data frame mtcars.    
```{r}
plot(mtcars$drat,mtcars$mpg)      
```      

Notice this is the same plot function we used above for 1 variable!
    


## R is really vectorized
Look at all of the correlations
```{r}
cor(mtcars)
```

The sapply() function applies the scale() function to every column in the data frame simultaneously.
``` {r}
df <-sapply(mtcars,scale)         # Center and scale all of the variables
boxplot(df, col="yellow")         # Compare the distributions of the variables
```

## Fit a simple regression model
```{r}
reg1 <- lm(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$drat)
summary(reg1)        
```
Notice that the same function summary() we used above to give us the summary of a vector is used to give us a summary of the regression model re
```{r}
anova(reg1)          # Standard analysis of variance table

# Plot the data with the regression line added
plot(mtcars$drat,mtcars$mpg, main="Regression Model")
abline(reg1,col="red")
par(mfrow=c(2,2))    # Some code to put the 4 plots together
plot(reg1) 
str(reg1)            # Look at the model object
reg1$coefficients    # Pull out the coefficients
```

## Clean up
```{r}
rm(mtcars)           # Remove mtcars
rm(list=ls())        # Remove everything: USE WITH GREAT CARE!!
```
