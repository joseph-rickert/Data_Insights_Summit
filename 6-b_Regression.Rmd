## Regression Analysis
This module takes you the process of fitting a multiple regression model. The data come from the UCI machine Learning Repository. The data is described here:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/auto-mpg/auto-mpg.names, and here: http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall00/G22.3033-001/weka/weka-3-0-2/data/auto-mpg.arff

### Setup   
Here we load the required libraries and a user defined function  
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(corrplot)

# Function to divide data into training, and test sets 
index <- function(data=data,pctTrain=0.7)
{
  # fcn to create indices to divide data into random 
  # training, validation and testing data sets
  N <- nrow(data)                                     
  train <- sample(N, pctTrain*N)                              
  test <- setdiff(seq_len(N),train) 
  Ind <- list(train=train,test=test)
  return(Ind)
} 

```  

### DATA 
We fetch data from the UCI MAchine Learning Repository
```{r}
url <-"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/auto-mpg/auto-mpg.data"
mpg <- read.table(url,stringsAsFactors = FALSE,na.strings="?")

# For later use: write to disk and read in again
write.csv(mpg,"mpg_orig.csv",row.names=FALSE)
mpg <- read.csv("mpg_orig.csv")
```  
### Data Preparation
```{r}
#Look at the data and reset some of the data types
names(mpg) <- c("mpg","cyl","disp","hp","weight","accel","year","origin","name")
head(mpg)
dim(mpg)

# Count the numberof missing values in the data
length(which(is.na(mpg))==TRUE)
# Remove the missing values since there are only six of them
# In a serious work you might want to think about imputing 
# or setimating the missing values
mpg <- na.omit(mpg)

sapply(mpg,class)
summary(mpg)
mpg <- mutate(mpg, hp = as.numeric(hp),
              year = as.factor(year),
              origin = as.factor(origin))
sapply(mpg,class)
``` 

### Exploratory Data Analysis
In this section we look at numerical summaries of the data as well as various plots to visualize relationships among the variables
```{r}
summary(mpg)
# Look at correlations among the numeric variables
mpg.num <- select(mpg,mpg,cyl,disp,hp,weight,accel)
cor(mpg.num)

corrplot(cor(mpg.num), method="ellipse")

# Look at the at pairwise relationships for continuous variables
pairs(mpg[,c(1,3:6)],                    # pairs is function that produces a maatrix of scatter plots
      panel=function(x,y){               # define a function panel for the content of the matrix 
        points(x,y, col="light blue")                       # plot the points
        abline(lm(y~x), lty=2,col="red") # add a linear regression 
      },
      diag.panel=function(x){            # define a new panel for the diagonals
        par(new=T)
        hist(x,main="",axes=F,nclass=12) # put a histogram on each diagonal
      }
)

# Look at distribution of mpg for discrete variables
# mpg by cyl
p1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(factor(cyl),mpg))
p1 + geom_boxplot()

# Plot mpg as a function of origin
# origin: 1 = USA, 2 = Europe, 3 = Japan
p2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(origin,mpg))
p2 + geom_boxplot()

# Plot mpg by weight and origin
p3 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(weight,mpg,col=origin))
p3 + geom_point()

# mpg by year
p4 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(year,mpg))
p4 + geom_boxplot()

```      

### Fit Regression Models
In this section we divide randomly divide the data into training and test sets and then fit several regression models to the training data. Holding out some data enables us to assess the performance of these models by seeing how well they predict mpg for the test data. This kind of process is essential if you want to get an idea of how well the model will perform on data that it hasn't seen before. 

The function, index, which is given above randomly splits the mpg data into two subsets: train and test. mpg[ins$train,] means index into the mpg data and return all of the columns of mpg but only the rows to be used for training the model.  

We select the model that has the best adjusted R squared value.
The first model uses just the numeric data.
```{r}
ind <- index(mpg)  # Split the mpg data into training and test data.
form.1 <- formula("mpg ~ cyl + disp + hp + weight + accel")
lm.fit.1  <- lm(formula=form.1,data=mpg[ind$train,])   # Build the model
summary(lm.fit.1)
```   
The second model looks at the effect of year. Note that the - 1 in the formula instructs R to build a model without an intercept term. This is an example of a "fixed effects model".
```{r}
form.2 <- formula("mpg ~ cyl + disp + hp + weight + accel + year -1" )
lm.fit.2  <- lm(formula=form.2,data=mpg[ind$train,])   # Build the model
summary(lm.fit.2)
```   
The third model looks at the effect of origin.
```{r}
form.3 <- formula("mpg ~ cyl + disp + hp + weight + accel + origin -1" )
lm.fit.3  <- lm(formula=form.3,data=mpg[ind$train,])   # Build the model
summary(lm.fit.3)
```   
### Model Diagnostics
Model 2 had the best adjusted R squared. In this section we create the standard model diagnostic plots to evaluate how well the model fits the assumptions underlying regressin models. Look here http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~martin/W2024/R7.pdf for some information on interpreting the diagnostic plots. Except for a few outliers flagged by by the plotting software everything looks pretty good.
```{r}
# Plot the regression diagnostics
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
c <- plot(lm.fit.2)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))

# Look at the outliers flagged in the diagnostic plots
outliers <- c(14,243,332,389)
mpg[outliers,]
``` 
### Assess Model Performance
Here we get an idea of how well the model will do on new data by using the predict function to "score" the new data set. We then plot the actual reported values of MPG against the values predicted by the regression with confidence intervals.

```{r}
predictions <- predict(lm.fit.2,mpg[ind$test,],se.fit=TRUE,interval="prediction")
# Create a data frame to hold the predictions
df <- data.frame(y = mpg[ind$test,]$mpg, predictions)
head(df,2)

#Plot predictions vs actuals 
# error bars = 1 standard deviation
p5 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = y, y = fit.fit))
p5 + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = fit.lwr, ymax = fit.upr), width = .1) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype=2) +
  xlab("Reported MPG") +
  ylab("Predicted MPG") +
  ggtitle("95% CIs for Predictions")
```     

This model looks pretty good! The 45 degree line, which indicates a perfect predictions, is mostly covered bu the confidence intervals. For homework, try creating some more exploratory plots and building additional regression models. What happens when you include both year and origin in a model?
